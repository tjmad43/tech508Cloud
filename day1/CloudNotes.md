# Intro to Cloud

## What is cloud computing?
- on-demand delivery of computing of power, storage, and other services 
- that is centrally managed and delivered as a serviceÃŸ

## How do we know if something is in the cloud? 

### If it's yes to all of these questions:
- delivered as a service over the internet?
- available on demand?
- centrally managed?

## The 4 deployment models of clouds:

- public
  - multi-tenant cloud - muliple occupants
  - shared with the public
  - owned and operated by a cloud service provider (e.g. aws)
- private
  - single-tenant cloud
  - may run over a private network (not the internet)
  - e.g. on a cruise ship
- hybrid
  - mix of one of above systems (usually pubic) and on-prem 
- multi-cloud
  - mix of multiple cloud providers used
  - e.g. certain things running on aws



## Types of cloud services - What are the differences?

- on-prem - control over everything
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - networking -> virtualisation managed by provider. e.g. virtual machine
- PaaS (Platform as a Sevice) - e.g. an app service. Only data and apllications managed by owner
- SaaS (Software as a Service) - only data managed by you. e.g. things like microsoft office
